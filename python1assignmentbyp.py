1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
ans= expression(mathematical operator)
'hello'
ans= value(string)
-87.8
ans= value(foat)
-
ans= expression(mathematical operator)
/
ans= expression(mathematical operator)
+
ans= expression(operator)
6
ans= value(integer)

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
ans= string is itself a datatype in python and the value which can be stored in the variable.
eg: 'this is string'
variable is used for storing the values in a variable and variables are need not to be declared at the start in python.
a=10

3. Describe three different data types.
ans=data types or the class is same, data can be either a numbers,strings and etc. here, there are majorly 3 data types used in pyhton
1:string contains the string of letters in it,it can be stored as a value in a variable.
there are three types to write a sting, it can be enclosed in ("")double quotes,('')sindle quotes or three of each('''or""").
2:integer are numeric terms such as whole number,positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length,e.g.0,100,-10. it can be stored as values in a variable,
x=10
3:float type are the numbers which can be positive , negative real numbers with a fractional part denoted by decimal symbol(.),e.g. 123.45,-2334.44.
f=1.34
type(f)
"float"
4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
ans=expression is made up of variable  ,values and the operator, and the expression is used for evaluation.
x=8
z=x+4
z=12
5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
ans:spam=10 , the expression evaluates to a value and statement executes something 

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
ans= 23

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
ans='spamspamspam'

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid? 
ans: variable names can only have name,number and underscore,but only number can't be used as variable name it should start with name or underscore only.
_name1,name1,name=valid variables
9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
ans: for integer :-int()
for floating point number:-float()
for string:-str()
10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
ans= string can concatenate string only not integer,
we can fix the error by replacing 99 to "99"
